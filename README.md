# KettleOn

_A team building app for remote workers. Get to know your teammates, boost morale and spend time mingling. 
Play games, quizzes and learn more about each other.
Designed for a modern style of working._

The site features a series of team-building quizzes and games for remote workers to participate in and get to know one another.
Managers or team leaders can sign their team up via the registration link on the landing page, and add members via the dashboard. User data is stored on Kinde and MongoDB.
A daily icebreaker question helps team members to open up about their personal interests, and the answers feed into a quiz each week.
Our leaderboard inspires a little healthy competition to encourage team members to play against one another.

## Tech stack

This is a fullstack [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

We used UI components from [ShadCN](https://ui.shadcn.com/) and [Aceternity](https://ui.aceternity.com/), as well as video hosting from [Next-Videos](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-videos) and TailwindCSS styling. The site is built in TypeScript.

Our backend API service was built with tRPC/TanStack Query, MongoDB and Mongoose. 

We used [Kinde](https://kinde.com/) for authentication, utilising both their NextJS SDK and their API.

We used the ChatGPT API to build our "Mastermind-style" general knowledge quiz.
